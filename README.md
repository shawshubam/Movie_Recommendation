🚀 Introducing My Content-Based Movie Recommendation System! 🎬

🎥  Overview:
Check out my latest project where I developed a movie recommendation system using content-based filtering! This system provides personalized movie suggestions based on user preferences and movie features.

🔍 What's Covered:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Using movie datasets from IMDb/TMDb.
Feature Engineering: Extracting and processing genres, directors, cast, and plot keywords.
Recommendation Algorithm: Leveraging TF-IDF and cosine similarity to find similar movies.
Implementation: Backend with Python (pandas, scikit-learn, numpy) and an interactive frontend with Streamlit.
👨‍💻 Demonstration:

Input user preferences.
Generate and refine movie recommendations.
Explore movie details in an interactive UI.
Conclusion:
Content-based filtering offers a tailored movie-watching experience by analyzing movie content and user preferences. This project showcases the application of machine learning and data processing techniques in creating effective recommendation systems.
